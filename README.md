How to play

Objective: Collect as much money as you can without dying.

Move your character using A and D keys. Use the arrow keys to dig but be careful, some materials need more than one hit. Finally, jump using the spacebar.

Randomly, a Warning signal appears and lava starts to emerge. Move your character to the surface in order to survive.

If you go deeply you will find more and bigger treasures but the probability of danger increases as well.
